    <goal>Solve the Homework number: <![CDATA[<input>INPUT</input>]]>

        Get access to the page
        https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~cis1940/spring13/lectures.html

        to review the different Homeworks and check in the repository in
        sandbox/src/main/java/info/jab/cis194/

        a new package named homeworkX with a range from 1 to 12
        where X represent the week provided in the INPUT.

        if in the repository doesn't exist a homeworkX, X represent the week, in that case take the minimum one which is not solved in the repository.
        In other case, continue with the next Homework if exist a previous one.
        If you are in Homework 9, jump to Homework 10 or higher.

        Every homework has associated a Lecture, a Homework document and maybe some associated documents.

        Example:

        In the week 1,
        exist a Lecture: https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~cis1940/spring13/lectures/01-intro.html
        and a Homework: https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~cis1940/spring13/hw/01-intro.pdf

        Process both documents, the first one to take the context about the ideas behind and later implement the Homework associated.

        In the first Homework, the document in PDF format describe a set of Exercise
        to be implemented in Java 25.

        Update the VM to Java 25 using the command `sudo apt install -y openjdk-25-jdk`

        Understand the problem do a good analysis to implement the solution.
        Apply TDD so, create in tests the new package:

        sandbox/src/test/java/info/jab/cis194/homework1

        and Exercise by Exercise create the Test first:

        sandbox/src/test/java/info/jab/cis194/homework1/Exercice1Test.java

        Once you have the initial test, execute:

        ./mvnw clean verify

        and it will fail but this is something normal because you don't have the implementation.

        Implement the solution in:

        sandbox/src/main/java/info/jab/cis194/homework1/Exercice1.java

        and execute:

        ./mvnw clean verify

        This time it should pass the test, in order case, review the implementation

        When one Exercise passes the tests, commit and Push to the PR and continue.

        Follow this steps for all Exercises included in the Homework
